([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

# Netflix-Viewer  

This is a simple linux app running netflix.com in a browser. The motivation is to have a standard Netflix app that desktop users can easily access and add to favourites. Castlab fork of electron was used to avoid WVVMP issues. 

## Local installation using NPM

Test with  
```
npm run start
```

Built with electron-builder npm package  

```
npm run dist 
```

Login and upload to snapcraft    

```
snapcraft login  
snapcraft upload --release=stable dist/netflix-viewer_X.X.X_amd64.snap
```

## Local installation using Snapcraft

Make sure you have snapcraft installed  

Edit the snapcraft.yaml file and change npm install to "sudo npm install" (needed when building with default multipass)   
Build   

```
snapcraft  
```

The resulting package can be uploaded to edge channel  

```
snapcraft upload --release=candidate netflix-viewer_0.9.0_amd64.snap  
```
